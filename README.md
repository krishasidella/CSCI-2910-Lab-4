# CSCI-2910-Lab-4
Lab 4 lab about weather APIs

## Issues
- Accidentally saved the .env file so I had to go into the terminal and correct it in there
- Could not figure out to run the code through the terminal because the file paths were wrong then I created a new folder with all the codes and it worked
- My location key was not defined and had an error so I figured out it had to do with my api key
